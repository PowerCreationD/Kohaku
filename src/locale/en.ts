            introduction: `Kohaku Studio was founded between 2021 and 2022.
            The story began with a group of young people from diverse backgrounds.
            Driven by the desire to return to their original aspirations, they rooted themselves in Taiwan.
            Fuelled by their vision for the future of agriculture, they delved deep into the traditional industries.`,

            mission_values: `While retaining the cultural heritage,
            We still continuously bring new energy and creativity.
            By combining local and international perspectives,
            We drive the integration of information and design.

            From planning to marketing,
            From design to engineering,
            From origin to downstream industry,
            From heritage to innovation.

            With a mindset of interdisciplinary integration,
            Connect all endpoints.
